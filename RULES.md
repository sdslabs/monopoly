Rules
===

Elements
----
1. Based on IITR Map containing all/most IITR buildings.
2. Non circular/rectangular map with boundaries.
4. *Properties*. All locations at IITR. For optimization, some buildings very close to each other may be omitted.
5. No Roads (these complicate the map too much). Later probably.

Banking Rules
----
1. The *objective* is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and selling of property.
2. Each player receives an intital amount.
3. Each player moves a random number of steps, in directions allowed by his current position on the map).
4. If the player lands on an unowned property, he may buy it for the price listed on that property's space. If he agrees to buy it, he pays the Bank the amount shown on the property space and receives that property.
6. If the player lands on his or her own property, or on property which is owned by another player but currently mortgaged, nothing happens.
7. If a player path passes through property owned by other players, he would still need to pay them. 
11. Players may not loan money to other players, only the bank can loan money, and then only by mortgaging properties.
14. (PLANNED) If the player lands on *Income Tax* he must pay either a specific amount of money (based on his current assets).
13. 15. (DOUBT) Properties are arranged in *groups* of two or three properties. Once a player owns all properties of a color group (a monopoly), the rent is doubled on all unimproved lots of that color group, even if some of the properties are mortgaged to the Bank.

Movement Rules
----
1. Each player randomly starts from a starting point.
2. **For one move, a player can make a choice to go to any available location based on current location. For multiple moves, this is repeated and path is generated.**
4. *Choice element*. There are multiple paths which gives you a choice when moving, unlike monopoly, where only the number on the die decides where you go.
5. Boundaries are enforced wherever applicable.

Additional Ideas
----
1. (DOUBT) **Fog of war** You can only see the properties associated with the square you are on (and which is unmortgaged). Buying streets removes fog of war. Makes the game much more strategic.
2. (DOUBT) Spies, Reveal Map etc which allows you to view a given area of the map, or track enemy movement for a turn or two.
3. (POSSIBLE) *Properties which generate income per turn, without needing the enemy player to have to come to that property. Generated income will always be less than rent income.*

Miscellaneous
----
1. (PLANNED) **Leaderboard system** Every game gives you certain ranking points based on the money you accumulated and other factors. 
3. (LATER) **Game modes** With different gameplay and victory conditions.
